GPEA Members,

We will be holding a listening session on 10/9 (the second Wednesday of the month) from 12-1pm in the Ridge Room at City Hall. This is an opportunity to meet with your GPEA representatives, discuss the collective bargaining process, and to help us identify your priorities and values moving forward in negotiation.

Hope to see you there!

Erik Rose\
GPEA President\
