Hello Members,

The time is fast approaching for GPEA to hold officer elections, as we are reaching the end of our current two-year term. We are announcing a Listening Session on Thursday, June 26th at noon in the Ridge Room to recruit candidates for the next election cycle.

Come join us for a brief description of the four officer roles, and let us answer your questions about GPEA. Even if you do not want to be an officer, come and chip in your two cents. Meet the folks who will be running and make us work for your vote.

Light snacks provided. Hope to see you there!

Erik Rose\
GPEA President
