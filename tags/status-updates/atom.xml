&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;To:&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mandy Hayes, Director of Human Resources&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;From:&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erik Rose, GPEA President&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Date:&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&#x2F;18&#x2F;2025&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Subject:&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Parking Change Grace Period Request&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 17th, GPEA received notice from management of a change in parking accommodations, to occur on Wednesday, April 23rd, five business days after notice. This letter is a request to provide a notice period of seven business days, consistent with our agreement for members receiving notice of a change in workplace rules [19.2].&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our organization appreciates that management has provided an alternative parking option, in recognition that parking benefits are a significant element in the total compensation package of an employee, and a long-standing benefit within our workplace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that many of our members feel obligated to park in the designated municipal lot, so that they do not impede residents trying to visit City Hall, or one of the many small businesses clustered along the nearby streets. Even when we are off-shift and walking to our cars, residents perceive us as representatives of the City government, and may resent us parking on the street when they cannot park in the municipal lot. Generally speaking, our members will park where told, which is why this is a change in workplace rules.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the alternative parking were more convenient, haste would be one thing, but the new location is farther away. This is an unpleasant adjustment for our career-oriented members, who fear that “temporary” parking could mean years. Given how long the current parking rules have been in place, we feel it is reasonable to request the full seven days notice, moving the transition date to no earlier than April 28th.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your careful consideration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Rose&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://grantspassemployeeassociation.github.io/news/events-20250416/">&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Memorandum&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;&lt;&#x2F;thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;To:&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mandy Hayes, Director of Human Resources&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;From:&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Erik Rose, GPEA President&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Date:&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&#x2F;16&#x2F;2025&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Subject:&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proposed Parking Benefit Reduction&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue is regarding the upcoming vote of the City Council on the proposal to use the City Hall employee parking lot as a resting area. As a majority of GPEA members park in this lot, we feel the proposal constitutes a material change in employee compensation for our unit, and we would expect to meet and confer on this change, preferably as part of the normal bargaining process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss in quality-of-life and convenience, above and beyond monetary cost, presents a significant burden relative to our current benefit. We are particularly concerned about impacts on the minority of our members experiencing mobility issues. With local crime rates spiking adjacent to the resting areas, it is difficult for us to tell our members that they will be equally as safe under the proposed change.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parking benefit also has a market value. The City currently charges $240 for a yearly pass to park in the Redwood, Duck or Brown Bear lots, which is a reasonable proxy for the value of a parking spot. We view the loss of parking as equivalent to a $240 reduction in salary for affected employees.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is such a common benefit in the public sector that we have previously seen no need to raise this issue in negotiation. There is no specific language in the CBA detailing the parking benefit. However, this benefit remains a basic element of employee compensation. Long-standing members cannot remember a time &lt;em&gt;before&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; having this benefit, and incoming employees expect it as a part of their overall package.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to invite management to engage with GPEA on the subject of the parking benefit, so that we can resolve this issue together, rather than taking unilateral action outside of the bargaining process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Erik Rose&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
GPEA President&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
