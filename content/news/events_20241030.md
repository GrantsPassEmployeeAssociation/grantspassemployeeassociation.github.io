GPEA Members,

Our first listening session on October 9th was a success, with eight members in attendance to talk collective bargaining and enjoy some light snacks.  After a short introduction, members did most of the talking while I wrote stuff down.  My thanks to James for helping to moderate, and kicking in out of pocket for the snacks.

Subjects of interest identified by our members include:

- A 32-hour work week option.
- Education incentive for higher degrees (Masters etc.).
- Hybrid and work from home (WFH) options.
- Juneteenth recognized as a paid holiday.
- Regular distribution of City-branded logo gear.
- Improved access to comp time.

Keep an eye out in your inbox for our email survey, and let us know what you think!

Erik Rose
GPEA President
