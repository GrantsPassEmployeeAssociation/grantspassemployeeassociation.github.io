## Hybrid Work<a id="hybrid"></a>

Hybrid work refers to an employee working a portion of their work week remotely, from a home office or other suitable environment away from their assigned office space. Employees may elect to work a hybrid schedule, upon the discretion of the employee’s supervisor. Management retains discretion to ensure availability and meet demand for service in customer-facing roles.

These additional restrictions apply:

- Employees may not work remotely more than the following thresholds without prior approval from their supervisor:
  - 16 hours per week
  - 32 hours per pay period
  - 800 hours per year
- Employees will complete a VPN Access Form.
- IT will evaluate and approve the home office equipment.
- Employees will provide consistent internet access.
- Employees will provide an alternative means of contact (e.g. cell phone) in addition to their primary work computer.

  - Utility Billing Lead
- City Fleet Service Yard
  - Lead Mechanic

## Incentives<a id="incentives"></a>

Incentives are a tool for the City to retain and expand institutional knowledge, promote skill growth and professional development. Certifications enable employees to serve management and council with greater expertise. Certified employees operate with increased efficiency in delivering services to the public and reduce costs. Lack of continuing certification leads to a deterioration of knowledge and skills over time, which can increase staff time and training costs.

Management will reimburse the cost for materials and testing upon successful completion of the following certifications. Workers will receive a pay incentive as a percentage above base pay according to the following:

- Parks
  - Certified Parks and Recreation Professional (CPRP) - 5%
