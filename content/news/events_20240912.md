GPEA Members,

City management sat down with GPEA this Thursday (Sept. 12) to discuss upcoming insurance benefits for the year 2025. Donna Anderson and myself attended the meeting representing GPEA. Some good news that I can share is that employee costs appear to be trending downward.

Currently, we are discussing continuing with Providence as a provider for the upcoming year. If you have any concerns about staying with this provider, please let us know. If you have had a negative experience, or encountered undue frustration, the time to address these concerns with our provider is now. Please do not divulge personal medical details, it is enough to tell us how the experience made you feel, and we will relay your concerns to management without bringing up your name.

Feel free to reach out to James, Donna or myself, by email, phone or in person. We want to hear from you as a member.

Thank you,\
Erik Rose\
GPEA President
