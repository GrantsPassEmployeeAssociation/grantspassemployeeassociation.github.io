          <description xml:base="https://grantspassemployeeassociation.github.io/news/events-20241003/">&lt;p&gt;GPEA Members,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City management met with GPEA representatives and a representative from Hart Insurance to continue discussing upcoming insurance benefits for the year 2025.  Takeaways from the meeting for members:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employee costs are still on track to go down next year.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providence will continue to be our provider.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pacific Source may be able to offer an HMO alternative to Willamette Dental Group that would continue to offer a lower-cost dental option while expanding access to more providers in town.  No specifics yet, but we have been vocal about expressing the difficulties our members have experienced accessing care through WDG, and this is a potential avenue for improvement.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the process, please reach out to Donna or myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Erik Rose&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://grantspassemployeeassociation.github.io/news/events-20240912/">&lt;p&gt;GPEA Members,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City management sat down with GPEA this Thursday (Sept. 12) to discuss upcoming insurance benefits for the year 2025. Donna Anderson and myself attended the meeting representing GPEA. Some good news that I can share is that employee costs appear to be trending downward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are discussing continuing with Providence as a provider for the upcoming year. If you have any concerns about staying with this provider, please let us know. If you have had a negative experience, or encountered undue frustration, the time to address these concerns with our provider is now. Please do not divulge personal medical details, it is enough to tell us how the experience made you feel, and we will relay your concerns to management without bringing up your name.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to reach out to James, Donna or myself, by email, phone or in person. We want to hear from you as a member.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Erik Rose&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
GPEA President&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
