GPEA Members,

City management met with GPEA representatives and a representative from Hart Insurance to continue discussing upcoming insurance benefits for the year 2025.  Takeaways from the meeting for members:

* Employee costs are still on track to go down next year.
* Providence will continue to be our provider.
* Pacific Source may be able to offer an HMO alternative to Willamette Dental Group that would continue to offer a lower-cost dental option while expanding access to more providers in town.  No specifics yet, but we have been vocal about expressing the difficulties our members have experienced accessing care through WDG, and this is a potential avenue for improvement.

If you have any questions about the process, please reach out to Donna or myself.

Thank you,\
Erik Rose\
GPEA President
